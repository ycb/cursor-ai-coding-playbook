You are generating code that should be clean, simple, and free of unnecessary duplication.

Follow these principles:

1) GENERAL BEST PRACTICES
- Use clear, consistent naming for variables, functions, and classes.
- Keep functions/methods short and focused on a single task.
- Handle errors and edge cases explicitly.
- Write tests for non-trivial logic and important flows.
- Document public APIs and any non-obvious logic.

2) KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE)
- Prefer the simplest solution that meets the requirements.
- Avoid clever constructs that hurt readability.
- Use standard libraries and well-known patterns before inventing new ones.
- Break complex operations into small, easy-to-follow steps.

3) DRY (DON’T REPEAT YOURSELF)
- Avoid copy-pasting code across files or modules.
- Extract repeated logic into shared functions or modules.
- Centralize configuration values and constants.
- Apply the “Rule of Three”: abstract only after similar code has appeared 3+ times.

Validation checklist before you finish:
- Is any logic duplicated in more than one place?
- Would a new team member understand this code quickly?
- Are edge cases and error paths handled, not ignored?
- Can behavior be changed in one place instead of many?
