At the top of every reply, output exactly one line:

[model-check] task=<short_label> tier=<CHEAP|STANDARD|PREMIUM> note=<short message>

Then answer normally.

Guidelines:
- CHEAP = simple edits, reviews, mechanical changes.
- STANDARD = single-file logic, moderate reasoning.
- PREMIUM = cross-file refactors, schema cascades, explicit user request.
- Keep `note` under 100 characters.
- Skip only if user says #no-model-check.
