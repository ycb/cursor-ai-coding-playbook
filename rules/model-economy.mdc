# MODEL ECONOMY RULES (BE CONCISE + STRICT)

Your goal is to minimize unnecessary token usage, avoid accidental model escalation,
and keep the workflow predictable and affordable.

## 1) PARALLELISM
- Do NOT encourage multiple heavy agents for: CROSS_FILE_REFACTOR, HEAVY_SPEC_OR_RESEARCH, large BULK_GENERATION.
- Parallel work is OK only for SIMPLE_EDIT, REVIEW_OR_LINT, docs, or tests.
- If unsure, default to sequential execution and say so.

## 2) CONTEXT MINIMIZATION
- Avoid repo-wide scans. Work from the smallest relevant set of files.
- For tasks involving >5 files, propose a short plan and ask for confirmation.
- Summarize files instead of loading full contents when possible.
- Never auto-load “related files” unless explicitly requested.

## 3) PREMIUM / HIGH-TIER MODELS
- PREMIUM (Codex, high tiers) only when:
  - multi-file consistency is required,
  - refactors affect tightly coupled schemas/APIs,
  - or user explicitly requests premium depth.
- Never escalate to PREMIUM for SIMPLE_EDIT, REVIEW_OR_LINT, or minor BULK_GENERATION.
- Never use “thinking-mode” variants unless user explicitly asks for step-by-step deep reasoning.

## 4) CROSS-FILE EDITS
- Before multi-file edits: list the files, the changes, and the reason.
- Wait for user confirmation before touching many files.
- Prefer surgical diffs over full-file rewrites unless specifically asked.

## 5) AUTOMATION & QA
- Browser automation is expensive. Use only when:
  - agent claims work is ready,
  - pre-PR validation,
  - verifying a stable flow.
- Do NOT repeatedly run E2E automation during active iteration.

## 6) LARGE / EXPENSIVE WORK
- If a task touches multiple layers or >5 files:
  - Propose a short plan first.
  - Ask whether to proceed or narrow scope.
- Warn user when a task may consume significant tokens.
- Keep reasoning concise unless explicitly asked for depth.

## 7) TOKEN OVERRUN PROTECTION
- If your estimated output may exceed ~3M tokens:
  - Pause and ask: “This may be expensive — should I proceed or reduce scope?”

## 8) MINIMAL DIFFS
- Default to: “Make the smallest possible change.”
- Avoid full-file rewrites unless explicitly allowed.

## 9) TASK SIZE DISCIPLINE
- Encourage atomic, single-purpose tasks.
- Avoid mixing concerns in one request.
- Smaller tasks = smaller contexts = stable cost.

## 10) RESPECT USER WORKFLOW
- The user optimizes spend manually via model selection and rules.
- Do NOT override this with auto-escalation or unnecessary expansions.
