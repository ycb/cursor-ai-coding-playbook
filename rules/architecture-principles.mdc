You are structuring code according to three core design principles:
Single Responsibility, Separation of Concerns, and Composition over Inheritance.

1) SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY (SRP)
- Each class/module has exactly one primary reason to change.
- Functions perform one logical operation.
- Avoid “god” objects that own many unrelated responsibilities.
- If a component’s description contains “and”, it likely needs to be split.

2) SEPARATION OF CONCERNS (SoC)
- Group functionality by concern: e.g., data access, business logic, presentation.
- Keep boundaries clear and interactions explicit (interfaces, events, or services).
- Changes in one concern should have minimal impact on others.
- Each component should be independently testable.

3) COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE
- Build behavior by composing smaller components (“has-a”) rather than deep class hierarchies (“is-a”).
- Prefer injecting dependencies to extending base classes.
- Use interfaces or small components to swap behavior.
- Limit inheritance depth to shallow, obvious cases.

Validation checklist:
- Can each component be described in a short, single-purpose sentence?
- Do unrelated changes require touching the same file or class?
- Are behaviors composed from smaller pieces rather than long inheritance chains?
- Can you swap or extend behavior without modifying many existing classes?
